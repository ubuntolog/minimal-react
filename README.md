# Home.Ht application form for tenants
This is a simple web application that has a Java backend and a React-based frontend.

# How do I start it?

```
mvn clean package docker:build
```

## Development
First, you need to build the frontend. Go to `src/main/resources/frontend` folder and run (npm and node are required):
```
make dependencies
```

While working on the frontend it is better to turn on the development mode, since it will refresh your browser after
each change in the source code:
```
make run_webui_dev_server
```

If you need to add a new dependency, you should modify `src/main/resources/frontend/package.json`. After that remove
old dependencies by removing `src/main/resources/frontend/webui/node_modules` folder. Rerun:
```
make dependencies
```

To run the backend use the following options (Java 8 is required):
```
server minimal-react.yaml
```
